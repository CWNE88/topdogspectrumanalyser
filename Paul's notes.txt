Why does hackrf_fft use 'device'
self.device.read_samples(sample_size)

while rtlsdr_fft uses 'sdr'
self.sdr.read_samples(sample_size)


Issues:

HackRF FFT source can't be reselected because it's already in use. Probably not closed off, but does it need to be?

RTL FFT source does full restart when reslecting it. Like the HackRF, can't it just be kept open for quick switching back correctly?

Startup shows this message (after I added the 2d/3d switch functionality)
QWidget::setLayout: Attempting to set QLayout "" on QWidget "graphical_display", which already has a layout

HackRF amp doesn't seem to be on (or something else weird). There's no signal, yet if I use the HackRF in gqrx there's plenty of signal
device.enable_amp()  

Why does res bandwidth output text need space before Hz when others don't? Maybe check if <1000
self.output_res_bw.setText(self.engformat(self.data_source.sample_rate / self.INITIAL_SAMPLE_SIZE) + " Hz")
